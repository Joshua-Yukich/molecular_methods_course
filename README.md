# TRMD-8080 Advanced Molecular Epidemiological Methods

This repository contains data and R scripts for demonstrating 
some basic approaches to the use of repoducible methods to analysis
of nucleic acid data and genetic sequencing in R. 

The main goal is to illustrate some basics of Analytic reproducibility 
rather then to teach the full technical approachs to sequence alignment, 
molecular phylogeny, estimation of mutation rate and outbreak reconstruction. 

## Required tools 

The excercises here will be conducted concurrently with session five 
of the course. Students are expected to have already installed git 
(GitHub Desktop, SourceTree or similar) and R with RStudio. 

## Introduction and other readings
Instructions and basic lectures on these approaches as well as other reading
 documents are contained in the repository as well as on the CANVAS site. 
 Lecture slides also accompany these and several videos on basic introductions
 to R/RStudio and git are also on the CANVAS site.
