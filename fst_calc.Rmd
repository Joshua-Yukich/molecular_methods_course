# **What is Fst?**
Fst (Fixation Index) is a measure of genetic differentiation between populations. It quantifies how genetic variation is partitioned among populations relative to the total genetic variation. It ranges from **0 to 1**, where:
  - **Fst = 0** → No genetic differentiation (populations share the same alleles at the same frequencies).
- **Fst = 1** → Complete genetic separation (populations have entirely different alleles).

### **Why is Fst Important?**
Fst helps in understanding:
  - Population structure and gene flow.
- Evolutionary processes like natural selection and genetic drift.
- Conservation biology, by identifying genetically distinct populations.

  ## **How to Calculate Fst?**
  Fst is calculated using allele frequencies across populations. The basic formula is:
  
  \[
    F_{ST} = \frac{H_T - H_S}{H_T}
    \]

Where:
  - **Ht (Total heterozygosity)**: Expected heterozygosity in the entire population (pooled across subpopulations).
- **Hs (Subpopulation heterozygosity)**: Average expected heterozygosity within each subpopulation.

### **Step-by-Step Calculation of Fst**
#### **Step 1: Calculate Allele Frequencies**
For a biallelic locus (two alleles, e.g., A and a), suppose we have two populations:
  
  | Population | \( p_A \) | \( p_a \) |
  |------------|------------|------------|
  | Pop 1 | 0.6 | 0.4 |
  | Pop 2 | 0.8 | 0.2 |
  
  #### **Step 2: Compute Heterozygosities**
  The expected heterozygosity for each population is:
  
  \[
    H_s = 2 p q
    \]

For Pop 1:
  \[
    H_{s1} = 2 (0.6)(0.4) = 0.48
    \]

For Pop 2:
  \[
    H_{s2} = 2 (0.8)(0.2) = 0.32
    \]

The average heterozygosity across subpopulations:
  
  \[
    H_S = \frac{H_{s1} + H_{s2}}{2} = \frac{0.48 + 0.32}{2} = 0.40
    \]

#### **Step 3: Calculate Total Heterozygosity**
The overall allele frequencies across populations:
  
  \[
    \bar{p} = \frac{p_1 + p_2}{2} = \frac{0.6 + 0.8}{2} = 0.7
    \]
\[
  \bar{q} = 1 - \bar{p} = 0.3
  \]

Total heterozygosity:
  
  \[
    H_T = 2 \bar{p} \bar{q} = 2(0.7)(0.3) = 0.42
    \]

#### **Step 4: Compute Fst**
\[
  F_{ST} = \frac{H_T - H_S}{H_T} = \frac{0.42 - 0.40}{0.42} = \frac{0.02}{0.42} \approx 0.048
  \]

  ### **Interpretation**
  - **Fst ≈ 0.048** means there is very little genetic differentiation between the two populations.
- Generally:
  - **Fst < 0.05** → Low differentiation
- **0.05 - 0.15** → Moderate differentiation
- **0.15 - 0.25** → High differentiation
- **Fst > 0.25** → Very high differentiation

Would you like me to calculate Fst for real data? If you provide allele frequencies, I can compute it for you.
